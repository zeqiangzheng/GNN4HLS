**Extraction and benchmark-specific scripts**

The scripts detailed in these subfolders are useful to process standard benchmarks such as PolyBench etc.

See the *extract/* subfolder to see how to generate the summary reports *HLS_report.csv* and *RTL_report.csv* as well as the following graph files for each benchmark:
- adj_matrix.npy
- graph_dic.json
- node_features.csv
